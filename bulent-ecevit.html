          <p>Bülent Ecevit, (born May 28, 1925, Istanbul, Turkey—died November 5, 2006, Ankara), Turkish poet, journalist, and politician who served as prime minister of Turkey in 1974, 1977, 1978–79, and 1999–2002.</p>

<p>After graduating from Robert College in Istanbul, Ecevit served as an embassy official in London from 1946 to 1950. During this time he also attended the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. He returned to Ankara as a writer and journalist with the newspapers Halkçi and Ulus, the official organ of the Republican People’s Party (RPP), which his father had represented in the National Assembly.</p>

<p>Ecevit was elected to the National Assembly as an RPP member for Ankara (1957, 1961) and Zonguldak (1965, 1969), having joined the party council in 1959. He gradually emerged as leader of the left-of-centre group, and during his service as minister of labour (1961–65) he legalized strikes for the first time in Turkish history. In 1966 Ecevit became secretary-general of the RPP under İsmet İnönü, whose cooperation with the country’s military government he opposed. Ecevit became chairman of the RPP in 1972 and prime minister in January 1974.</p>

<p>As head of government, Ecevit declared an amnesty for all political prisoners and authorized (July 20, 1974) Turkey’s military intervention in Cyprus after the Greek-led coup on that island. His request for a vote of confidence from the National Assembly in September 1974 failed, and, after a severe political crisis, tenuous power passed to Süleyman Demirel of the Justice Party. After further crises in 1977, during which Ecevit briefly formed a government (June 21–July 3), he was again prime minister in January 1978. Acute economic and social difficulties, however, led to the fall of his government in October 1979.</p>

<p>Ecevit remained active in politics and was deputy premier in 1998 when Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was forced to resign following a corruption scandal. Ecevit formed a new government, and in April 1999 his Democratic Left Party won a plurality of votes. A coalition government was created, with Ecevit as prime minister. Months after he took office, Turkey suffered a devastating earthquake, and Ecevit drew criticism for the government’s slow initial response to the crisis and its refusal to allow Muslim groups to participate in relief efforts. A staunch secularist, Ecevit had pledged to curb the growing influence of Islam in Turkish politics.</p>

<p>At the start of the 21st century, Ecevit’s administration faced a number of challenges. The Turkish economy continued to falter, and the country experienced its worst recession in some 55 years. There was also bitter opposition to a number of reforms, including the abolition of the death penalty and increased civil rights for Kurds, that were meant to ease Turkey’s admittance to the European Union; after much political maneuvering, the EU-related reforms were eventually passed by the National Assembly. The situation worsened in May 2002 when Ecevit became ill but refused to name an acting prime minister. There were calls for his resignation, and subsequently numerous party members and ministers resigned, which caused Ecevit’s coalition to lose its parliamentary majority. In July 2002 the National Assembly voted to move up elections, which were held in November 2002. Ecevit’s Democratic Left Party was overwhelmingly defeated, receiving about 1 percent of the votes.</p>

<p>Among Ecevit’s literary works are a Turkish translation (1941) of Rabindranath Tagore’s song poems, Gītāñjalī, and a translation (1963) of T.S. Eliot’s play The Cocktail Party. A book of his original poetry, Bir şeyler olacak yarın (“Things Will Happen Tomorrow”), was published in 2005. His political writings include Ortanin solu (1966; “Left of Centre”), Bu düzen değişmelidir (1968; “The System Must Change”), Atatürk ve devrimcilik (1970; “Atatürk and Revolution”), Demokratik sol (1974; “Democratic Left”), and Işçi-köylü elele (1976; “Workers and Peasants Together”).</p>
